        Now, look here, my good man. Well, what do you want? Listen. Strange
        women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of
        government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the
        masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Knights of Ni, we are
        but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these
        woods. How do you know she is a witch? Who's that then? Ah, now we see
        the violence inherent in the system! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But
        she's got a wart. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest
        shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
        signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.
        That is why I am your king. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Ah, now we see
        the violence inherent in the system! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!
        You don't vote for kings. And the hat. She's a witch! Now, look here, my
        good man. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. We found
        them. Who's that then? Who's that then? Well, she turned me into a newt.
        Who's that then? Did you dress her up like this? Where'd you get the
        coconuts? The nose? And the hat. She's a witch! Why do you think that
        she is a witch? A newt? He hasn't got shit all over him. How do you know
        she is a witch? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us
        ride to Camelot! What a strange person. Well, she turned me into a newt.
        Why? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Why do you
        think that she is a witch? The swallow may fly south with the sun, and
        the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet
        these are not strangers to our land. Well, we did do the nose. Well, I
        didn't vote for you. Who's that then? What do you mean? Well, she turned
        me into a newt. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! On second thoughts, let's not go there.
        It is a silly place. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the
        system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Shut up! The Lady of the Lake,
        her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from
        the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur,
        was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. And this isn't my
        nose. This is a false one. I don't want to talk to you no more, you
        empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction!
        Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now
        leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! A newt? The swallow
        may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek
        warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. We
        shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. No, no, no! Yes,
        yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, we
        did do the nose. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the
        enchanter who lives beyond these woods. I dunno. Must be a king. …Are
        you suggesting that coconuts migrate? I have to push the pram a lot. We
        want a shrubbery!! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause
        some watery tart threw a sword at you! And the hat. She's a witch! And
        the hat. She's a witch! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Be quiet! …Are you suggesting
        that coconuts migrate? Shut up! Burn her anyway! …Are you suggesting
        that coconuts migrate? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who
        seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. The nose? I don't want
        to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I
        fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your
        father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you
        a second time! We found them. Did you dress her up like this? Where'd
        you get the coconuts? Well, she turned me into a newt. Where'd you get
        the coconuts? Bring her forward! I am your king. We found them. Now,
        look here, my good man. But you are dressed as one… I'm not a witch.
        Bring her forward! You don't vote for kings. The swallow may fly south
        with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes
        in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
